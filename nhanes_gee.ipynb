    "# Generalized estimating equations (GEE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalized estimating equations (GEE) is a regression analysis\n",
    "fromework that was first formalized in the 1980's, building on and\n",
    "unifying earlier work.  The main goal of GEE is to allow the framework\n",
    "of generalized linear modeling (GLM) to be able to handle certain types of\n",
    "dependent data.  GEE retains the relative simplicity of GLM, while\n",
    "enabling it to be used in a much wider range of settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like GLM, GEE is an approach for regression analysis, which means that\n",
    "it focuses primarily on the *mean structure* $E[y | x_1, \\ldots,\n",
    "x_p]$, where $y$ here is the dependent variable of the regression, and\n",
    "$x_1, \\ldots, x_p$ are the covariates.  As in GLM, a link function $g$\n",
    "is used, so we will be relating the mean to the linear predictor\n",
    "through the mean structure model\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g(E[y | x_1, \\ldots, x_p]) = b_0 + b_1x_1 + \\cdots + b_px_p.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A GEE regression also involves a mean/variance relationship function\n",
    "$f$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\rm Var}[y | x_1, \\ldots, x_p] = f(E[y | x_1, \\ldots, x_p]).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Other concepts from GLM like the scale parameter ($\\phi$) and family\n",
    "(e.g. `binomial`) play similar roles in GEE as they do in GLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new component of a GEE that is not present in a GLM is the\n",
    "*working dependence structure*, or *working correlation*.  This\n",
    "specifies how observations are related to each other.  Note that in a\n",
    "GLM, the observations are treated as being independent of each other,\n",
    "while GEE can accommodate many different forms of dependence between\n",
    "observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that the dependence structure in a GEE is referred to as a\n",
    "\"working\" dependence structure is that it does not have to be correct\n",
    "for the results of the regression to be valid.  If the working\n",
    "dependence structure is correct, the GEE results will be more\n",
    "efficient (i.e. the estimates will be more accurate, and the standard\n",
    "errors will tend to be smaller).  If the working dependence structure\n",
    "is incorrect, the parameter estimates will be less accurate, and\n",
    "the standard errors will be correspondingly larger.  But with enough\n",
    "data, the regression parameter estimates will still be accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is organized as a case study.  We begin by using data\n",
    "from NHANES (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey).\n",

    "Sometimes it is useful to apply a regression approach to simulated data.  This can be\n",

    "a statistical methodology.  Simulation of data for GEE regression presents a unique\n",
    "challenge because GEE is not based on a complete model for the data.  In a GEE, the mean structure\n",
    "is fully specified, and in most cases the marginal distribution of each observation\n",
    "is fully specified (however this is not true when using the quasi-likelihood familes).  The\n",
    "dependence structure is only specified through a working structure that does not need\n",
    "to be correct, and even if it is correct, it does not define the joint distribution of the\n",
    "data (except in very special cases like the Gaussian model).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways to resolve this challenge.  Below we will demonstrate how a copula\n",
    "approach can be used to simulate data for a GEE analysis.  The basic idea is that if\n",
    "$u_1, u_2$ are two random variables that may be dependent, such that $u_1$ and $u_2$\n",
    "are both marginally uniformly distributed, then for any cumulative distribution\n",
    "functions $F_1$,\n",
    "$F_2$, the random variables $y_1 = F_1^{-1}(u_1)$ and $y_2 = F_2^{-1}(u_2)$ are distributed\n",
    "according to $F_1$ and $F_2$.  In a GEE, we know the marginal distributions (except\n",
    "in the quasi-likelihood case that we will not cover here), so $F_1$, etc. are always\n",
    "known.  Thus, we can induce dependence between $y_1$ and $y_2$ by simulating $u_1$\n",
    "and $u_2$ to be dependent and (marginally) uniform.  Note that this approach works\n",
    "for any dimension, we are only using two components here for illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to simulate dependent $u_j$ that are marginally uniform is to simulate\n",
    "dependent $z_j$ that are marginally standard Gaussian, then define $u_j = \\Phi^{-1}(z_j)$,\n",
    "where $\\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF.  This approach is flexible because it is\n",
    "easy to generate Gaussian random vectors with a variety of different covariance\n",
    "structures, such that the components are marginally standard normal. This is\n",
    "called the \"Gaussian copula\" and is used in the illustration below."
