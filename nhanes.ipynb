    "# Basic regression using Python and Statsmodels -- a case study using the NHANES data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the main ideas of regression analysis,\n",
    "focusing on the practical aspects of fitting regression models in\n",
    "Python using the [Statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org) package. We\n",
    "will also be using the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) library for\n",
    "data management, and the [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) library for\n",
    "numerical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, regression analysis is a way of relating *inputs* to\n",
    "*outputs*.  For example, if we want to understand how the fuel\n",
    "efficiency of a car, measured in gallons per mile, relates to the\n",
    "vehicle weight and engine displacement, then the vehicle weight and\n",
    "engine displacement would be the inputs, and the fuel efficiency would\n",
    "be the output.  Note that this does not mean that we view vehicle\n",
    "weight and engine displacement as being the only direct determinants\n",
    "of fuel efficiency.  For example, the cross sectional area of the\n",
    "vehicle would also matter a lot (for aerodynamics).  Regression\n",
    "modeling can be used when we have one or more input factors that may\n",
    "partially explain the output, allowing us to estimate the precise way\n",
    "in which the inputs and outputs are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis has a long history, and there are multiple terms\n",
    "for most of the key concepts.  The \"output\" discussed above is more\n",
    "often called the *dependent variable*, the *outcome*, or the\n",
    "*response*.  The \"inputs\" discussed above are more often called the\n",
    "*covariates*, *regressors*, or *independent variables*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression analysis and conditional distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "A more formal way of looking at regression analysis is through the\n",
    "idea of a *conditional distribution*.  Switching to another example\n",
    "that we will consider in more detail below, let $y$ denote a person's\n",
    "blood pressure, and let $a$ and $g$ denote their age and gender,\n",
    "respectively.  Our data represent a population, for example, all\n",
    "adults in the United States.  There is a \"marginal mean\" of all blood\n",
    "pressure values in this population, which can be estimated using the\n",
    "sample mean (average value) of all the blood pressure values in our\n",
    "data set.  There are also many different \"conditional means\", which\n",
    "capture the mean blood pressure for all adults in the US with a\n",
    "particular age and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to use the term \"expectation\" to refer to a mean or\n",
    "average value in a population, and denote it by the letter \"E\".  Thus,\n",
    "$E[y]$ is the (marginal) expected blood for all US adults, and $E[y |\n",
    "a, g]$ is the conditional mean blood pressure for all adults of a\n",
    "particular age and gender.  For example, $E[y | a=35, g=F]$ is the\n",
    "conditional mean blood pressure for all 35 year-old women in our\n",
    "population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly analogous to conditional means is the concept of \"conditional\n",
    "variance\".  The marginal variance $Var[y]$ is the variance (expected\n",
    "squared deviation from the mean) of the whole population.  The\n",
    "conditional variance $Var[y | a=35, g=F]$ is the variance of $y$ for\n",
    "the subpopulation of 35 year-old women.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most forms of statistical analysis, the goal of regression is\n",
    "to use the sample to learn about the population, and to quantfy the\n",
    "estimation error in doing so.  Since we have a finite sample of data,\n",
    "we are not able to recover $E[y | a,g]$ directly, but rather will only\n",
    "be able to estimate it.  We can then use the tools of statistical\n",
    "inference (e.g. standard errors, confidence intervals, and hypothesis\n",
    "tests) to assess how precisely we have recovered the \"estimation\n",
    "target\" $E[y | a, g]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NHANES\n",
    "\n",
    "The National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES) is a\n",
    "study sponsored by the US government that has run in waves since the\n",
    "1970's.  Each NHANES wave is a cross sectional study of around 10,000\n",
    "people, selected to represent the US adult population at a particular\n",
    "point in time.  A large number of measures are made on each of the\n",
    "NHANES subjects.  Here we will focus on basic demographic\n",
    "characteristics, body dimensions (e.g. height or BMI), and blood\n",
    "pressure (systolic and diastolic, measured three times each).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the NHANES data were collected as a designed survey, and in\n",
    "general should be analyzed as such.  This means that survey design\n",
    "information such as sampling weights, strata, and clusters should be\n",
    "accounted for in any analysis using NHANES.  But to introduce how\n",
    "linear regression is used with independent samples of data, or with\n",
    "convenience samples, we will not incorporate the survey structure of\n",
