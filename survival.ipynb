    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Survival analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis)\n",
    "is used to analyze data in which the primary variable of interest is a\n",
    "time duration.  Some examples of duration data that can be analyzed using\n",
    "methods from survival analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A person's lifespan\n",
    "\n",
    "* The duration that a person survives after being diagnosed with a\n",
    "serious disease\n",
    "\n",
    "* The time from the diagnosis of a disease until the\n",
    "person recovers\n",
    "\n",
    "* The duration of time that a piece of machinery remains in good working order\n",
    "\n",
    "* The time after a person looses a job until they find a new job\n",
    "\n",
    "* The time after a person is released from prison until they are arrested again\n",
    "\n",
    "Duration data can be used to answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the mean duration for a population?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the 75th percentile of the durations in a population?\n",
    "\n",
    "* When comparing two populations, which has the shorter expected or median duration?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is a given predictor variable associated with a duration outcome?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key concepts in duration analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Time origin__: The durations of interest correspond to time\n",
    "  intervals that begin and end when something specific happens.  It is\n",
    "  important to be very explicit about what defines the time origin\n",
    "  (time zero) from which the duration is calculated.  For example,\n",
    "  when looking at the survival duration of people with a disease, the time\n",
    "  origin could be the date of diagnosis.  When looking at human\n",
    "  lifespans (\"all cause mortality\") it might make sense to define\n",
    "  the time origin to be the date of birth.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Event__: This term refers to whatever happens that concludes the\n",
    "  time interval of interest.  It may be death, or some other type of\n",
    "  \"failure\", or it may be something more favorable, like recovery or\n",
    "  cure from a disease.  Most survival analysis is based on the idea\n",
    "  that every subject will eventually experience the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Survival time distribution__: This is a marginal distribution\n",
    "  defining the proportion of the population that has experienced the\n",
    "  event on or before time T.  Usually it is expressed as the\n",
    "  complementary \"survival function\" (e.g. the proportion of people who\n",
    "  have not yet died as of time T).\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Censoring__: Censoring occurs when we do not observe when a\n",
    "  subject experiences the event of interest, but we do have some\n",
    "  partial information about that time.  The most common form of\n",
    "  censoring is _right censoring_, in which we observe a time T such\n",
    "  that we know the event did not occur prior to time T.  Other forms\n",
    "  of censoring are _interval censoring_ and _left censoring_.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Risk set__: This is the set of units (e.g. people) in a sample at\n",
    "  a given time who may possibly experience the event at that time.  It\n",
    "  is usually the set of people who have not already experienced the\n",
    "  event and who have not been censored (but the risk set may be only a\n",
    "  subset of these people when using \"entry times\").\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Hazard__: This is the probability of experiencing the event in the\n",
    "  next time unit, given that it has not already occurred (technically,\n",
    "  this is the discrete time definition of the hazard, the continuous\n",
    "  time definition involves rates but follows the same logic).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Marginal survival function and hazard estimation\n",
    "------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The *marginal survival function* is a function $S(t)$ that returns\n",
    "the probability that a randomly-selected member member of the population\n",
    "experiences the event after time $t$ (equivalently, that they have not\n",
    "experienced the event as of time $t$).\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no censoring, the marginal survival function can be\n",
    "estimated using the complement of the empirical [cumulative\n",
    "distribution\n",
    "function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function)\n",
    "of the data.  If there is censoring, the standard method for\n",
    "estimating the survival function is the product-limit estimator or\n",
    "[Kaplan Meier\n",
    "estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier_estimator).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the Kaplan-Meier estimate is not difficult.  Group the\n",
    "data by the distinct times $t_1 < t_2 < \\ldots$ (times here can be either\n",
    "event times or censoring times), let $R(t)$ denote the risk set size\n",
    "at time $t$, and let $d(t)$ indicate the number of events at time t (if\n",
    "there are no ties, $d(t)$ will always be equal to either 0 or 1).  The\n",
    "probability of the event occurring at time $t$ (given that it has not\n",
    "occurred already) is estimated to be $d(t)/R(t)$.  The probability of\n",
    "the event not occurring at time $t$ is therefore estimated to be $1 -\n",
    "d(t)/R(t)$.  Finally, the probability of making it to time $t_k$ without\n",
    "experiencing the event is estimated to be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(1 - d(t_1)/R(t_1)) \\cdot (1 - d(t_2)/R(t_2)) \\cdots (1 - d(t_k)/R(t_k)).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A consequence of this definition is that the estimated survival\n",
    "function obtained using the product-limit method is a step function\n",
    "with steps at the event times.\n",
    "\n",

    "itself, we first estimate the cumulative hazard function, then differentiate\n",
    "it to obtain an estimate of the hazard function.  Some smoothing and interpolation\n",
    "is needed to estimate the derivative a function that is estimated with a\n",
    "(non-differentiable) step function.  We do not cover these details here, but\n",
    "some examples of how this may be done are shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Statsmodel, the code `sm.SurvfuncRight(time, status)` estimates the marginal\n",

    "of interest (if `status=1`) or to the last time when the event\n",
    "was known not to have occurred (if `status=0`).\n",
    "\n",

    "## Regression analysis for survival/duration data\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis is used to understand how one or more factors of\n",
    "interest are related to an \"outcome\" variable.  If the\n",
    "outcome variable is a duration, we are doing *survival regression*.\n",
    "\n",
    "By direct analogy with linear regression, we might seek to model the\n",
    "expected survival time as a function of covariates.  If there is no\n",
    "censoring, we could, for example, use least squares regression to\n",
    "relate the survival time $T$, or a transformation of it (e.g. $\\log(T)$)\n",
    "to a linear function of the covariates, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E[\\log T | x] = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + \\cdots b_p x_p.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is sometimes done, it is more common to approach regression\n",
    "for duration data by modeling\n",
    "the hazards rather than by directly modeling the duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, the hazard is the conditional probability of experiencing the event of\n",
    "interest at time $T$, given that it has not yet occurred.  For example,\n",
    "in a medical study this may be the probability of a subject dying at\n",
    "time $T$ given that the subject was still alive just before time $T$ (in\n",
    "continuous time we would substitute \"rate\" for \"probability\" but we\n",
    "ignore this distinction here).\n",
    "\n",
    "In survival regression, we view the hazard as a function that is\n",
    "determined by the covariates.  For example, the hazard may be\n",
    "determined by age and gender.  A very popular form of hazard\n",
    "regression models the conditional hazards as multiples of\n",
    "a shared *baseline hazard function*, specifically\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h(t, x) = b(t) \\cdot \\exp(b_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\ldots + b_p \\cdot x_p),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b(t)$ is the \"baseline hazard function\", the scalars\n",
    "$b_0, \\ldots, b_p$\n",
    "are unknown regression coefficients, and the $x_j$ are the observed\n",
    "covariates for one subject.  Note that there is no intercept term\n",
    "($b_0$) in the linear predictor, since it could be factored out\n",
    "as a factor of $\\exp(b_0)$ and absorbed into the baseline hazard\n",
    "function $b(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model can also be written in log\n",
    "form\n",

    "where $b = (b_0, \\ldots, b_p)$, $x = (1, x_1, \\ldots, x_p)$.\n",
    "Thus, the log hazard\n",
    "is modeled as a time-varying intercept plus a linear predictor that is\n",
    "not time varying (there are generalizations of this model\n",
    "in which the linear\n",
    "predictor is also time-varying).\n",
    "\n",
    "This regression model is called [proportional hazards\n",

    "## More on censoring\n",
    "\n",
    "A large part of survival analysis is concerned with appropriately\n",
    "handling censoring (if there is no censoring, it is generally possible\n",
    "to analyze the log durations using standard, non-survival methods).\n",
    "Censoring can be a subtle topic.  All survival methods have\n",
    "limitations on the type of censoring they can handle, and it is not\n",
    "always easy or even possible to determine in a given setting whether a\n",
    "survival method can accommodate the type of censoring that is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things more concrete, we usually imagine that every subject\n",
    "has both an event time $T$ and a censoring time $C$.  That is, every\n",
    "subject would eventually experience the event (if there were no\n",
    "censoring), and would eventually be censored (if the event did not\n",
    "happen).  We observe ${\\rm min}(T, C)$, and a *survival status*\n",
    "indicator of whether the event occured\n",
    "occured (i.e. that ${\\rm min}(T, C)$ is equal to $T$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key requirement for most surival methods is that we have\n",
    "\"independent censoring\", meaning that $T$ and $C$ are statistically\n",
    "independent quantities.  Since we never observe both $T$ and $C$ for the\n",
    "same person, it is usually not possible to directly assess whether $T$\n",
    "and $C$ are dependent.  However knowledge about the data collection\n",
    "process is often used to assess whether independent censoring is\n",
    "plausible to hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one type of censoring that is quite common is\n",
    "\"administrative censoring\".  This occurs when a study has a fixed data\n",
    "collection window, say a thee year interval from January 1, 2012 to\n",
    "January 1, 2015.  Suppose that people are randomly recruited into the\n",
    "study, and if the event has not occured by January 1, 2015, the\n",
    "subject is censored.  Thus, subjects who are recruited into the study\n",
    "later are more likely to be censored.  As long as the reruitment date\n",
    "is not dependent with the true survival time, $T$ and $C$ are independent.\n",
    "However we can imagine a setting when administrative censoring may\n",
    "induce dependence, e.g. if the subjects recruited later in the study\n",
    "were healthier than those recruited earlier.  But in many situations,\n",
    "this can be excluded as a likely circumstance based on knowledge of\n",
    "how the study was conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in some cases there is strong reason to believe\n",
    "that subjects are more likely to be censored as they grow sicker,\n",
    "which may mean that $T$ and $C$ are positively dependent.  For example, if\n",
    "we have medical study in which the data come from insurance records,\n",
    "as people get sicker they are more likely to become unable to work,\n",
    "and may have to quit their job (leading to them being censored).\n",
    "Similarly, as people age they may retire or become eligible for\n",
    "Medicare, leading to age-dependent censoring.  Since age is likely\n",
    "correlated with survival time, this could also induce dependent\n",
    "censoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "One remedy for dependent censoring is to identify covariates such that\n",
    "$T$ and $C$ become independent after conditioning on the covariates.  For\n",
    "example, age or a measure of overall health may be sufficient to\n",
    "substantially reduce the dependence between $T$ and $C$.\n",
    "\n",
